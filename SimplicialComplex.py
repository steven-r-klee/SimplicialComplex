Class: SimplicialComplex

Defines a simplicial complex object.  A simplicial complex is defined in terms
of two pieces of information:

1. A set, V, of vertices
2. A set of /faces/: a collection of subsets of V that is
   /closed under inclusion/, meaning that if F is a face and G is a subset of F,
   then G is a face as well.
